        <p id="tribute-info">Kurt Donald Cobain (February 20, 1967 â€“ April 5, 1994) was an American musician who was the lead vocalist, <br> guitarist, primary songwriter, and a founding member of the grunge rock band Nirvana</p>
        <p>He was born in the small logging town of Aberdeen, Washington. Cobain had a generally happy childhood <br> until his parents divorced when he was nine years old. After that event, he was frequently troubled and angry, and his emotional pain became a subject of, and catalyst for, much of his later music</p>
